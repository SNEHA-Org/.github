Health Equity amongst the urban poor can be a powerful agent of change. Similar to health being critical to a child's development, health equity is an indispensable milestone of a community's development. This can be achieved by strengthening the community's capacity to access public health services while working with public health systems to provide quality services and by changing knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. SNEHA (Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action) is a step towards bridging the health equity gap and going beyond fighting illness to Raising Health For All.

A continuum of care RMNCH+A (Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health) means working with women and children from birth to adulthood in order to break the intergenerational cycle of poor health.

Addressing gender-based inequities is an underlying area of focus across all programmes that SNEHA undertakes, because this is often at the heart of health inequity in communities.

SNEHA works with vulnerable communities, public health and safety systems to develop evidence-based models to address urban health challenges.
